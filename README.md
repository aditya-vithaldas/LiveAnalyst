# LiveAnalyst / Meridian

Conversational analytics with Gemini 3.8 Live, an on-page `show_analytics` tool, CSV/Excel uploads, and a cloud-hosted DuckDB e-commerce demo.

## Experience

- Blank initial canvas; each question replaces it with the answer.
- Neutral gray/white theme, voice orb, and optional example questions.
- Time-series charts by default; a specific date produces a large numeric widget unless a breakdown is requested.
- Multiple CSV, XLSX, XLS files or a folder. **10 MB maximum total**, checked before reading. Over-limit batches are rejected, never truncated or compressed.
- Uploaded rows stay in browser memory for the session. Gemini receives schemas and query context; a constrained query plan is evaluated against all local rows. Arbitrary joins and calculated-column expressions are not currently supported for uploads.
- Demo mode uses a persistent synthetic 2025 database, not newly invented model answers. 10 tables, 10,000,000 rows, 150,000 customers. The UI reports the actual hosted database size.
- Charts: line, area, bar, horizontal/stacked bar, pie, donut, scatter, funnel, heatmap, histogram, radar. SQL result shape: `label`, `value`, optional `secondary`.

## Local development

Node 22+. `npm install`, then configure `GEMINI_API_KEY` in ignored `.dev.vars` for the Sites runtime. Never put it in browser code. `npm run dev` starts the website. The portfolio build uses `npx vite build --config vite.portfolio.config.ts` and base `/analytics/`.

The demo backend is separate: `node server/build-demo.mjs` creates `data/ecommerce.duckdb` and `data/schema.json`; run `node server/api.mjs` for the private SQL service. Database files are ignored by Git. `server/Dockerfile` reproducibly builds the dataset and serves it read-only on Cloud Run. The website gateway uses the existing server-side Gemini Secret Manager reference. The private DuckDB service has no Gemini key and requires Cloud Run IAM authentication. `server/gateway.mjs` is the gateway handler integrated into the existing website server.

## Schema and query contract

See [docs/demo-schema.json](docs/demo-schema.json), [docs/AGENT_SCHEMA.md](docs/AGENT_SCHEMA.md), and the live `/schema` endpoint. The website gateway includes the complete schema and semantic rules in the model prompt, gets SQL, validates a single SELECT statement, and executes DuckDB with external access and extension loading disabled. Query execution is capped at 8 seconds; results above 1,000 groups require a narrower query and are not silently truncated.

The service keeps a small query-plan cache; it still executes SQL on every request. The response identifies cache hits. Each cloud instance has its own immutable database copy baked into the versioned image, avoiding a remote-file scan on every query.

## Measurements

The same five browser-observed metrics as the shopping demo: first audio, first action, tool RTT, visible action, and barge-in. Voice baselines use local VAD; typed requests use submission time. Unobserved metrics remain blank. SQL and AI planning are shown separately. The 1–2 second goal applies to database queries; AI planning and network time can make total response time longer. See benchmark reports in `docs/` for measured values and environment.

## Checks

- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-analytics.mjs`
- `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/check-uploads.mjs`
- `node scripts/benchmark-demo.mjs`
- `npm run build`
